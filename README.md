# Kane Creek Development Petition

### About
The goal of the original project was to practice HTML and CSS skills by copying a static comp. I was able to pursuade my instructors into letting me go off the rails and create this form instead. Much of the design inspiration came from the Bernie Sander's website.

The point of the petition was mostly to provide a platform for community members to voice their opposition to the proposed luxury estate development in the sensitive Kane Creek area. I had a feeling most people in Moab would agree that this would be a net loss in various ways. 

I had big ideas to get it fully functional (like capture the data) but decided it would take me too long. I barely know what a backend is, let alone how to build one. Probably a good thing, because it would be a disaster if it broke. 

I enjoyed working on this a lot and am very thankful my insructors gave me permission to execute this passion project!
