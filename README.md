# Kane Creek Development Petition

### About
The goal of the original project was to practice HTML and CSS skills by building out a static comp. I was able to persuade my instructors into letting me go off the rails and create this petition form instead. The idea behind this was to provide a platform for the community to express concerns about a proposed development in the Colorado River corridor near Moab, Utah. It would be used as a tool to gather contact information for organizing efforts and to provide quantifiable evidence of overwhelming public opposition. Much of the design inspiration came from the Bernie Sanders' website. It is not a true static comp, but I certainly did put my CSS and HTML skills to the test! Mission success.

My goal with the petition was to get something legit up and running in a short period of time, so I decided to use Google Forms instead of trying to make this form fully functional. I ended up using JavaScript on the .xlsx file from the Google form to categorize different types of responses and contact information. Yay for array prototype methods!

I enjoyed working on this a lot and am very thankful my instructors gave me permission to execute this passion project. ðŸ§¡
