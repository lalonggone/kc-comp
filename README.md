# Kane Creek Development Petition

## About

This project was originally an assignment to practice HTML and CSS skills by building a static comp. However, I chose to deviate from the assignment to create a petition form addressing the proposed development in the Colorado River corridor near Moab, Utah. While the form itself is not functional due to the scope limitations of the assignment, it serves as a concept for gathering community feedback and organizing efforts against the development.

## Purpose

The goal of this survey was to provide a platform for the community to express concerns about the proposed development on Kane Creek. It would gather contact information for organizing efforts and provide quantifiable evidence of public opposition (there is a LOT). The design was inspired by the Bernie Sanders' campaign website.

Due to time constraints and other risks, I used Google Forms to create and share a functional petition. The responses from the Google survey were mapped and filtered through an Excel file to categorize different types of responses and contact information. Shoutout array protoype methods!



## Demo

*Note: The form is not functional.*
